# Mirror Universes: Reflections of Ourselves in Time and Space

This installation consists of **54 triangular mirrors** — each 25 cm in size, each its own universe. These mirrors are not merely physical surfaces but **symbolic portals** that reflect the many facets of our being. Every person we encounter, every moment we live through — they are all reflections of ourselves. Some reveal our **past**, others place us firmly in the **present**, while still others hint at possible **futures**.

The **triangle** as a shape symbolizes **movement and balance** — between **body**, **mind**, and **soul**. Reflections break and bend at different angles, reminding us that our identity is never singular or fixed, but **multifaceted** and constantly evolving. The 54 mirrors represent **54 windows into the inner cosmos**, through which each viewer sees something different — depending on their **perspective** and what they are **seeking**.

This is a **journey toward the self through others** — through reflections that may be **sharp**, **distorted**, or **beautifully honest**. Because it is in those reflections that we begin to truly understand **who we are**.
